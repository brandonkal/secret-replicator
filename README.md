# About

This project is an experiment to understand how to build a Kubernetes controller. This project uses [Wrangler](https://github.com/rancher/wrangler).

I am currently using [this image](https://hub.docker.com/layers/brandonkal/secretgen-controller/kbld-rand-1584175775559302948-172218161125138/images/sha256-1eaf21ce23f257acac2fade6cdc41f663d3bb629797a424723298966e35217dc?context=explore) which is based on k14s/secretgen-controller.

To run clone the repo and run. Please use go modules.

```
make run
```
